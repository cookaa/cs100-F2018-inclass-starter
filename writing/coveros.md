# Review of the Presentation About the Coveros Corporation

## Adam Cook

## Explain what you learned about Coveros and careers in the technology field

Coveros implements an agile approach to computing. They work on shifts of about
two weeks at a time where they develop a model of what they are trying to
accomplish, then update and check that they are going in the right direction.
This approach is great because it allows for the continual update and progression
in the right direction rather than going a year creating a product that you
are not certain that the contractor wants.
For our presenter, he has spent the past six years at Coveros, since he graduated
from Allegheny College. During his first year, he worked on research, making sure
that users were truly users and not computers. After this, he began to develop
for them. He worked on several products where he used applications from which we
are learning about now. After this time, he began to help others with their
development, by becoming a contractor.
After the presentation, from those who sent him resumes, we had interviews. I
got to learn more about the company and what they do along with things that they
use in the professional field. Of the languages currently available, he uses
Java the most day to day.
Overall glad we had the opportunity to learn about an application of what we are
learning about in class, and to see what some of the alumni can do out of college.
